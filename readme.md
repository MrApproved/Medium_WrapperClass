# Wrapper Classes - Medium

---

This repository is made for my Medium blog post titled Wrapper Classes - A Little Helper For Everyone - C# Example

This repository contains 3 examples of a wrapper class.

The first example is a simple file storage class which uses the System.IO.File framework library. The example shows how we can wrap that code into something we can replace and unit test.

The second example is a bank account class which can deal with a few things, the code shows how we can create a wrapper around that existing object and extend the functionallity without actually changing the bank account class.

The third example is a printer class that can be given jobs. We create a wrapper class which allows existing objects to be used as jobs, even though they are completely different objects.
